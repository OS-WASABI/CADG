//TODO: Implement this file and create a proper class out of the XMLParser functionality.
//NOTE: All documentation is temporarily duplicated from XMLParser.cpp until
//XMLParser.h is fully implemented.
///Parses existing SOAP XML documents and generates new CMAC XML documents.
/**
 * This class has two primary functions: Reading and writing XML documents.
 * The read functionality parses an existing SOAP XML document and stores
 * it in memory for future use via a CAPMessage struct. The write functionality
 * uses this struct to build a new CMAC XML document.
 * Base solution modified from the following tutorial:
 * https://akrzemi1.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/parsing-xml-with-boost/
 *
 * @file        XMLParser.h
 * @authors     Ross Arcemont
